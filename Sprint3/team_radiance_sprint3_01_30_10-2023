Minute Meeting #1
Date: October 30, 2023

Topic: 
We divided the task to be completed during the current sprint. Ceyhun and Benjamin are going to be working on the backend implementation of 
the new features. Daniel is going to be developing the acceptance tests and link them to user stories. Steven is going to record all team meetings
and keep working on the front end. Alexander is going to help with task related to the front-end of the website and keeping track of team member 
contribution during this sprint.
For this meeting, we collectively designed 2 acceptance test (AT), which are directly linked with specific user stories to make sure that 
these user stories are successfully implemented. Moreover, we emphasized the integration of unit tests for the aditional classes and files 
added during the current sprint. We also made sure these unit tests could be automatically executed for every push/pull request to the main 
branch. This is going to ensure continuous integration pipeline within the repository.
Finally, we also decided to implement an interactive neighborhood map, which is going to provide valuable information about local amenities, nearby schools
and parks, and more. The integration of this map is essential because it offers potential buyers a comprehensive overview of the neighborhood. Also, it is going
to enhance user experience by providing convenient access to crucial information that influences purchasing decisions.
