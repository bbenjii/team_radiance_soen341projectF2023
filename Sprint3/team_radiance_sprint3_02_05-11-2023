In this meeting, 

In our recent meeting, we thoroughly strategized for Sprint 4, meticulously crafting user stories and decomposing them into tasks while 
assigning specific responsibilities to team members. The two targeted features for this sprint are a Mortgage Calculator for the Homebuyer
profile, involving tasks such as research for accurate calculation formulas, UI design, back-end implementation, rigorous testing, and seamless
integration. Additionally, we proposed an innovative productivity enhancement feature to distinguish our web app from competitors, with tasks
including competitor analysis, idea generation, prototyping, development, testing, documentation preparation, and an elaborate marketing strategy.
Our concerted efforts aim to streamline workflow, foster collaboration, and ensure the successful execution of Sprint 4's objectives.
