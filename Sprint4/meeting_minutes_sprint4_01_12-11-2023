We divided the tasks to be completed during the current sprint. Steven and Daniel are going to be working on the backend implementation, Benjamin
is going to update meeting minutes #1 and #2, while working on front-end development. Ceyhun is going to keep track of the contribution of each member
as well as adding unit tests for new classes/files developed during the current sprint to ensure Continuous Integration pipeline of the repository.
Alexander is going to write 2 acceptance tests for the user stories identified in sprint 3 and work on front-end features of the website. Collectively
as a team, each memeber is going to refactor the entire code to find software bugs and fix them, using automatic tools (FindBugs, SonarQube, ...). As a
